# TimeSeries

 * **Stationary** : A stationary process has the property that the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure do not change over time.

 * **Trend** : The linear increasing or decreasing behavior of the series over time.

 * **Seasonality** : The repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time.  Seasonality is always of **a fixed and known period** .

 * **Cycle** : A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are **not of fixed period**. The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years. Think of business cycles which usually last several years, but where the length of the current cycle is unknown beforehand.

### Smoothing Methods

 * Single Exponential Smoothing (a) 

 * Double Exponential Smoothing (a,b)

 * Triple Exponential Smoothing a.k.a. Holt-Winters (a,b,g)

### Statistical Methods

 * AR(p), MA(q), ARMA(p,q)

 * ARIMA (p,q,d)

 * SARIMA (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m
