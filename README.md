# TimeSeries

 * Stationary : A stationary process has the property that the mean, variance and autocorrelation structure do not change over time.

 * Trend

 * Seasonality

 * Cycle

### Smoothing Methods

 * Single Exponential Smoothing (a) 

 * Double Exponential Smoothing (a,b)

 * Triple Exponential Smoothing a.k.a. Holt-Winters (a,b,g)

### Statistical Methods

 * AR(p), MA(q), ARMA(p,q)

 * ARIMA (p,q,d)

 * SARIMA (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m
